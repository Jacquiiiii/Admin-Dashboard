### Database Dashboard

Database Dashboard is a single page application where users can view data organized by table name, filter by table name and search for data, add and delete users, and update inventory status. Currently the data displayed is for a fake book review website where users can see data for books, users, and book reviews. 

This project was designed and developed by Jacqui Koroll for development practice using fake data and is not intended for real use. The project contains a DB folder with sample setup code for a database with an example schema and seeds. It contains reusable query functions to interact with the database for select, insert, update, and delete queries.
